# Company Network Design

This repository presents a comprehensive network design for a company, outlining the architecture, topology, and configuration guidelines for establishing a robust and secure network infrastructure.

## Features

- Network Topology: The design incorporates a scalable and efficient network topology, taking into account the organization's requirements and growth plans. It includes the arrangement of routers, switches, and access points to ensure optimal connectivity.

- Network Segmentation: The network is divided into logical segments or subnets to enhance security, improve performance, and simplify network management. Each department or functional area is assigned to a specific subnet, allowing for easier access control and resource allocation.

- IP Addressing: The network design outlines the IP addressing scheme, including the allocation of IP addresses to devices and the implementation of appropriate IP addressing protocols such as IPv4 or IPv6.

- Network Security: Security measures are integrated into the design, ensuring protection against unauthorized access and potential threats. This includes the deployment of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, VPNs, and access control mechanisms.

- Redundancy and High Availability: The network design incorporates redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and minimize downtime. This includes redundant links, backup power supplies, and redundant network devices to maintain uninterrupted operations.

- Network Services: The design specifies the implementation of essential network services such as DHCP, DNS, email, file sharing, and remote access. It outlines the infrastructure and configurations required to support these services effectively.

- Scalability and Future Growth: The network design takes into account the organization's future expansion and growth plans. It provides scalability options, ensuring the network can accommodate increased traffic, additional devices, and emerging technologies.

- Network Management: The design includes network management tools and protocols for efficient monitoring, configuration management, and performance optimization. It outlines best practices for maintaining and troubleshooting the network infrastructure.
